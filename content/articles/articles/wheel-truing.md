Summary: 

If you aspire to do your own bike maintenance, chances are you've tried to true your own wheels, or you want to learn how. Maybe you've tried, but weren't satisfied with the results. Either way, you may have been told that truing is one of the [trickiest](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tooltips/truing.html) repair jobs a mechanic must learn, or that the wheel is one of the [Great Mysteries](https://www.wheelfanatyk.com/blog/wheel-building-tip-no-5-be-a-wheel-whisperer/) upon which even the Master must meditate.

Despite the mystique, plenty of riders learn to true their own wheels by following a simple set of guidelines:

* Be patient
* Inspect the wheel first
* Pay attention to spoke tension
* Start with small corrections, and check your work
* Make corrections to either radial, or lateral, but not both at the same time.
* Be patient
* Be patient

By following a simple algorithm of "find the worst spot and adjust it next," most errors can be corrected. How does the process work, and what can mechanics tell us about how wheels respond to adjustment?

#### Using the Wheel App to simulate wheel truing

The Wheel App can show you what happens when you adjust spokes. After you've designed your wheel, click on the __Forces__ tab, delete everything in the forces table, and add spoke adjustments in the adjustments table below. Spoke number 1 is the bottom-most spoke in the polar plot, or the center spoke in the column plot.

### What happens when you adjust a spoke?

The spoke is held in the rim
