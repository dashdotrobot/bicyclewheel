Title: What's the deal with butted spokes?
Date: 3 Jan 2019
Slug: butted-spokes
Summary: ...

We ask a lot of our spokes: they support our weight, keep our rims round, and sometimes hold baseball cards or other cultural signifiers. They don't ask for much in return other than a good, sturdy rim to keep them from losing tension and the occasional adjustment if your wheel gets damaged.

Not every part of the spoke works equally hard. The center section experiences only pure tension (provided the spoke never goes slack) and the fluctuations in the tension are generally small (e.g. less than 25% of the initial tension for the rolling stress). Side loads and impacts can cause larger fluctuations, but the center section will usually absorb these with no problem.

The ends of the spoke (the elbow and the nipple) experience much more complicated stress states. 

## Weight savings

## More flexibility

32 spokes
straight: 23.82 / 50 = 0.476
butted:   22.68 / 50 = 0.454
Difference of 1.14 kg for 50 kg load (about -5%)

36 spokes
straight: 22.17 / 50 = 0.443
butted:   21.07 / 50 = 0.421
Difference of 1.1 kg for 50 kg load (about -5%)

going to 36 spokes reduces force by about 7%

Analogy: Crowd-surfing with a flexible surfboard. The more flexible the surfboard, the more load is transferred to the people right underneath the surfer.

## Flexibility is strength!
