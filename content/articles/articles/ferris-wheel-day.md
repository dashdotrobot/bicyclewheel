Title: Celebrate National Ferris Wheel Day
Date: 14 Feb 2019
Slug: ferris-wheel-day
Summary: It's overshadowed by Valentine's Day, but National Ferris Wheel day is a chance the celebrate our love for the enduring pleasure and intricate mechanics of large wheels.

Today, most Americans will be [thinking of their loved ones while they frantically try to book dinner reservations](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-valentines-day-history-business-20170214-story.html). In our mad-cap black-friday-esque dashes to the novelty chocolate and [bizarre couple's gifts aisle](https://www.amazon.com/His-and-Her-Tongue-Scrapers/dp/B004IG4FJE), many of us will miss an equally-important and no-less contrived holiday: __National Ferris Wheel Day__.

Named for its inventor, [George Washington Gale Ferris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Gale_Ferris_Jr.), the [Ferris Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Wheel) was the centerpiece of the Chicago Columbian World Exposition. The "Chicago Wheel" was conceived as America's answer to the Eiffel Tower, which was considered the premier engineering marvel of the day (though almost universally panned as an aesthetic contribution to the Parisian skyline). Although the wheel was a financial success for the fair, Ferris himself was ruined by ensuing legal disputes regarding payment and ticket revenue. An engineering prodigy--he was only 34 when the wheel was built--Ferris died only three years after the fair from typhoid.

From the beginning, the engineering community was awed by the wheel. Speaking before a conference of engineers in 1893, William H. Searles summarized what was publicly known about the wheel and its construction.

> "The most conspicuous object that greets the eye of the traveler as he approaches the grounds of the Columbian Exposition from the south, or upon the elevated railroad from the north, is the now world renowned Ferris wheel. Its great circles described by day magnificent ellipses upon the sky, or by night shining with their myriad electric lights, they appear like a galaxy of stars..."

> "But it is not to the esthetic qualities of the wheel that I would call your attention particularly at this time. We are more concerned in the design of this structure as a work of engineering, and in the method of its erection. No complete description has been given to the public by the designers. On the contrary, when applied to, they have politely declined to furnish very much information."

> _W. H. Searles, Member, Civil Engineer's Club of Cleveland_

He went on to give a series of staggering sums: the rim measured 250 feet in diameter; the full weight of the wheel including passengers reached almost 3 million pounds; the shaft alone, the largest forging in the world up to that time, weighted 93 tons. Furthermore, the entire project was supervised by Ferris himself, only 12 years out of school, and the chief engineer, W. F. Gronau, only 5 years out of school.

### The Bicycle Wheel

The similarity between the Chicago Wheel and its young ancestor, the tensioned-spoked bicycle wheel, was not lost on fair attendees:

> "The spokes look like cobwebs; they are after the fashion of those on the newest make of bicycles"

> Julian Hawthorne (son of Nathaniel Hawthorne)

Prior to 1869, bicycle wheels were constructed in the same fashion (and often by the same craftsmen) as carriage wheels: a heavy, wooden rim was supported by stout wooden spokes, which carried the weight of the vehicle through compression.
