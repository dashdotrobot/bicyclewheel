  <h3>Sophisticated stress analysis</h3>
  <p>Results are based on a mathematical model of the wheel that takes into account the effects of spoke tension and rim compression. The model properly predicts the "softening" effect of excessive spoke tension: the lateral stiffness of the wheel is reduced due to the compression in the rim.</p>

  <h3>Library of rim properties</h3>
  <p>The stiffness properties of several rims have been measured using the <a href="https://rdcu.be/GPFI" target="_blank">acoustic method</a> developed by Dr. Matt Ford and Patrick Peng. You can select one of these pre-defined rims, or define your own by setting the bending and torsion stiffness manually.</p>
