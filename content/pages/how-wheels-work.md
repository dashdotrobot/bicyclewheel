# How does a bicycle wheel work?

The bicycle wheel is a triumph of elegance and simplicity. Despite rapidly-changing materials and manufacturing methods, a typical wheel built today resembles a typical wheel of the 1890s in its basic design and construction.

One reason for the success of the bicycle wheel is the efficient __division of labor__ between its components. __The rim__ supports the tire, spreads out loads to be shared by multiple spokes, and keeps the spokes under tension. __The spokes__ channels forces and torques between the hub and the rim. __The hub__ houses the hub bearing, and transmits torque (from the drivetrain or disc brake) to the spokes.

The rim and spokes work together to support _radial_, _lateral_, and _tangential_ forces:

* __Radial__ forces act (or outwards) towards the hub (away from the hub). The force from the ground on an upright, straight-running bicycle is a radial force.
* __Lateral__ forces act sideways, perpendicular to the plane of the wheel. Lateral forces are encountered when the bike is leaned sideways (without turning), when skidding, or in sudden steering maneuvers.
* __Tangential__ forces act in the direction that the rim turns. The force that propels the bike when pedaling, or stops the bike when braking, is a tangential force.

The spokes support these forces by changing their tension (more on that below). For example, when supporting the rider's weight, the spokes pointing toward the ground lose some tension. The spokes far away from the force (including the spokes above the hub) aren't very much affected. The difference between the high tension in the spokes above the hub and the (now) lower tension in the spokes below the hub add up to a _net_ force pointing upwards on the hub. When supporting a lateral force, the spokes on one side of the rim near the force increase their tension, while the spokes on the other side lose some tension. When supporting a tangential force, the "pulling" spokes increase their tension while the "pushing" spokes lose some tension. Since the spokes are angled forwards and backwards, the difference in tension produces a net force.

The stiffness of the rim prevents a single spoke from taking all the force by itself. Instead, the force is spread out to multiple spokes near where the force is applied. The number of spokes sharing the load is determined by the ratio of the rim stiffness divided by the spoke stiffness. The spokes are stiffest in the radial direction (because they point almost radially outwards). The spoke stiffness in the lateral direction is much smaller (on the order of 100 times smaller), and the tangential stiffness is comparable to the lateral stiffness. The rim is very stiff in the tangential direction and considerably less stiff in the radial and lateral directions. Therefore:

* In the __radial__ direction, the rim stiffness is low and the spoke stiffness is high, so the load is spread to __few__ spokes, usually 3 or 4 in a 36-spoke wheel.
* In the __lateral__ direction, the rim stiffness is low and the spoke stiffness is low, so the load is spread out to __several__ spokes, usually 8 to 10 in a 36-spoke wheel.
* In the __tangential__ direction, the rim stiffness is high and spoke stiffness is low, so the load is spread out to __many__ spokes, essentially evenly distributed around the entire wheel.
